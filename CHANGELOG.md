## [2.4.2] - 2026-07-04

### Changed — sub-1B specialized humanizer for short text

After a deeper HuggingFace audit + on-VPS testing of every candidate, swapped
the short-text backend from Qwen2.5-0.5B (general instruct) to
**`cive202/humanize-ai-text-bart-large`** (BART, 406M params).

- Peer-reviewed paper (Paneru 2026, "Make it Sound like Human")
- BERTScore 0.924 on test set — measurable fidelity, not marketing
- 25,140 training pairs with document-disjoint splits
- MIT license, updated April 2026
- The ONLY sub-1B specialized humanizer that ACTUALLY preserves length + facts
  on real inputs (verified on 84-word + 319-word test cases)

Auto-routing by input word count:
- ≤150 words → cive202 BART (sub-1B, 5–12s, faithful)
- >150 words → Ollama gemma3:4b (4B, 25–90s, only faithful option for long form)

Why the swap: Qwen2.5-0.5B worked on short text but hallucinated fake awards
and publications on long inputs ("Euratom Medal of the Russian Federation",
invented grants, etc.). Ateeqq/Text-Rewriter-Paraphraser produced garbage
tokens. amicus summarized. No sub-1B model is faithful on long text — cive202
BART-large is the only one that works on short, gemma3:4b is the only one
that works on long. Auto-routing was the honest compromise.

## [2.4.1] - 2026-07-04

### Changed — swapped humanizer backend to gemma3:4b

The first version of Rudra's Free Usage Model used `WhiteRoomProdigy/amicus-humanizer-v1-onnx`
(T5-base, 60M params). On real inputs it produced lossy, repetitive summaries
(84 words in → 19 words out, "scalable and maintainable" repeated in the same
sentence). The new backend is **Ollama `gemma3:4b`** with a 7-rule humanize
system prompt — faithful rewrites that preserve length, facts, names, and
structure. Same external API (no client change needed), same Oracle VPS, same
API keys.

- Latency: 1.2s → ~25s for a 100-word input (acceptable on free-tier ARM CPU).
- Quality: input 84 words → output 140 words, all facts preserved, detector
  score drops to ~6% AI probability on the humanized text.
- Free-tier footprint: stealth-models container dropped from 1.1 GB → 249 MB
  RAM because we no longer load the ONNX model in-process. The Python service
  now proxies `/humanize/` to Ollama over the docker bridge.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-07-04

### Added — Rudra's Free Usage Model (zero-config default)

- **New default provider: "Rudra's Free Usage Model."** The public Vercel
  deployment now ships with a pre-configured humanizer + detector pair hosted on
  the maintainer's free Oracle Cloud ARM VPS. No API key needed from the user —
  just paste text and click Humanize.
  - Humanizer: `WhiteRoomProdigy/amicus-humanizer-v1-onnx` (T5-base, 60M, ONNX INT8)
  - Detector: `fakespot-ai/roberta-base-ai-text-detection-v1` (RoBERTa-base, 125M)
- **Independent AI-detector verdict now shown below every humanize result.**
  After each successful humanize, the app automatically fires the hosted
  RoBERTa detector on the output and renders the verdict (Likely Human / Likely
  AI + AI probability) in a separate panel, distinct from the heuristic
  `finalScore`.
- **Server-side proxy module** (`lib/server/rudra-free.ts`) keeps the API keys
  in Vercel env vars (`RUDRA_HUMANIZER_API_KEY`, `RUDRA_DETECTOR_API_KEY`,
  `RUDRA_API_BASE_URL`). Keys never reach the browser bundle.
- **Settings UI** hides the API key field for Rudra's Free Usage Model and
  shows a "Pre-configured" notice instead.
- **Self-hosters** can opt out by setting `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_PROVIDER=gemini`
  (or any other provider id). See `.env.example` for the full set of new vars.

### Notes

- The detector's verdict is intentionally shown as a separate panel rather than
  blended into the heuristic score — RoBERTa detectors have a known high
  false-positive rate on formal prose, so the two numbers measure different
  things.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-06-28

### Fixed — humanization quality overhaul

This release fixes the root causes of broken output: incomplete sentences,
grammar/punctuation errors, and over-casual rewrites that "changed everything."

- **Re-humanize prompt rewritten.** The old prompt instructed the model to inject
  casual openers ("Honestly,"), em-dashes, rhetorical questions, and to split every
  long sentence — which produced orphan fragments ("Honestly?", "But get this—?").
  The new prompt forbids fragments and disconnected interjections, demands complete,
  grammatical sentences, and preserves meaning, facts, and register.
- **Post-processing no longer creates orphan sentences.** `disruptFlow` previously
  spliced in standalone interjections ("Right.", "Funny enough.") and rhetorical
  questions as their own sentences. It now only softens stiff AI openers in place.
- **Em-dash stripping is now punctuation-aware.** "word—?" no longer becomes the
  broken "word,?"; trailing/leading and parenthetical dashes are all handled cleanly.
  Numeric ranges (2020–2025) are still preserved.
- **Sentence-start capitalization safety net.** A final `capitalizeSentenceStarts`
  pass restores correct casing after every transformation, with abbreviation guards.
- **Removed casing-mangling transforms.** The random semicolon-merge and the
  short-sentence-merge both lowercased the following word, which broke proper nouns
  and safety-critical phrasing ("Never share keys" → "and never share keys").
- **Collocations now use word boundaries.** "facilitate" no longer matches inside
  "facilitated" leaving "make easierd"; inflected words are left intact. Literal
  "..." placeholders that injected stray ellipses were removed.
- **`thing→stuff` and similar context-blind safe-synonym swaps removed.**
- **`injectHumanVoice` no longer breaks proper nouns** (removed the conjunction
  prepend that forced-lowercased the next word).
- **Empty-string AI-phrase replacements** (`in conclusion → ''`) that left dangling
  commas now produce clean transitions.

### Changed

- **Removed the GPTZero API scoring panel** from the UI. With no `GPTZERO_API_KEY`
  configured it only ever showed a local fallback, which was confusing. Detection
  still runs locally (Human Score, heatmap, readability); external checking is a
  one-click link to GPTZero, ZeroGPT, and Copyleaks for anyone who wants it.
- **Humanize is now a single pass by default.** The automatic multi-round
  "refine to 90%+" loop that ran after every humanize (up to 8 extra API calls,
  blocking, and silently copying to the clipboard) is gone. Refinement is opt-in
  via the "Refine further" button (bounded to 3 rounds, no silent clipboard write).
- **Simpler, more professional UI.** Collapsed Advanced options by default, replaced
  the redundant 7-card stats grid with a slim footer bar, cleaned emoji-heavy action
  labels, and grouped external detector links. The sentence diff folds stray
  fragments into the previous row instead of showing misleading pairings.

### Fixed — tooling / CI

- **`npm run lint` works again.** Next.js 16 removed `next lint`; switched to a
  flat ESLint 9 config (`eslint.config.mjs`) using the TypeScript-ESLint tooling
  bundled with `eslint-config-next` (FlatCompat hit a circular-structure bug with
  this version combo).
- **CLI runners work on Windows.** `cli-providers.ts` now spawns `.mjs`/`.js`
  runners through `node`, avoiding Windows `spawn EFTYPE` on shebang scripts.
- **Browser extension least-privilege.** Removed the redundant always-on
  `<all_urls>` content script (the web app already reads `?text=` itself); kept
  `activeTab` as the minimal permission for tab messaging.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-06-02

### Added

- Full CLI tool (`stealthhumanizer` / `stealth-humanize`) with `humanize`, `detect`,
  and `providers` commands. Supports stdin, file I/O, JSON output, all rewrite levels,
  styles, tones, languages, and domains.
- Two local CLI-runner providers (`claude-code`, `codex`) that use existing CLI logins
  instead of API keys — confined with disabled tools, read-only sandbox, and isolated
  working directories.
- Batch humanization API (`POST /api/humanize-batch`) for up to 20 texts concurrently
  with 3 parallel API calls.
- GPTZero API integration with local heuristic fallback for AI detection scoring.
- Grammar checking API (`POST /api/grammar`) with LLM-backed analysis and local fallback.
- Protected region extraction/restoration — code blocks, links, URLs, and mentions are
  preserved verbatim during humanization.
- Rehumanize API (`POST /api/rehumanize`) with regression guard that falls back to
  lighter rewrites when semantic drift is detected (Jaccard + n-gram overlap).
- Logistic regression human-likeness scorer (`POST /api/model-score`) with 11 text
  features.
- File upload with magic-byte validation for PDF (pdfjs-dist), DOCX (mammoth), and TXT
  extraction (max 10 MB).
- Standardized API error handling module (`lib/api-response.ts`) with consistent error
  response format across all routes.
- Shared text utilities module (`lib/text-utils.ts`) deduplicating sentence splitting
  and word counting.
- Unit test suites for detector engine (25+ tests), rate limiter, and input validation.
- CLI regression test suite (18 tests) with mocked provider fetch and fake CLI runners.
- SEO: JSON-LD structured data, FAQ schema, programmatic robots.txt and sitemap.xml.
- `.env.example` documenting all 15 provider API key variables plus CLI overrides.
- SECURITY.md supported versions table and responsible disclosure policy.
- Comprehensive troubleshooting guide (`docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`).
- GitHub issue templates for bug reports, feature requests, and API key issues.
- Release workflow for tag-based GitHub releases with changelog validation.

### Changed

- Security hardening: Content-Security-Policy headers, X-Frame-Options DENY, HSTS,
  X-Content-Type-Options nosniff, per-IP rate limiting (30 req/min default), SSRF
  prevention via Cloudflare account ID validation, XSS-safe error responses.
- API routes enforce CLI-only provider rejection — browser and serverless contexts
  cannot spawn `claude-code` or `codex` subprocesses.
- Detector calibrated with corpus-derived thresholds instead of static heuristics.
- Architecture doc updated to reflect current provider count and module structure.
- CLI binary path configurable via `STEALTHHUMANIZER_CLAUDE_CODE_BIN` and
  `STEALTHHUMANIZER_CODEX_BIN` environment variables.

### Fixed

- Performance: `detectAI()` no longer re-runs on every React render (useMemo fix).
- EPIPE crash on CLI stdin when child process exits early.
- PDF upload parsing stability (pdfjs-dist replacing pdf-parse).
- Score regressions in rehumanize loop — regression guard prevents semantic drift.
- pnpm-lock.yaml synced with package.json (dotenv dependency added).
- CI/CD workflow branch triggers updated for `master` branch.
- Client bundle crash from `node:fs` import in browser-targeted `style-model.ts`.
- LinkedIn URL corrected in `Footer.tsx`.

### Security

- Per-IP rate limiting on all API routes with configurable window.
- Input validation on all endpoints (length, type, format checks).
- File upload magic-byte validation prevents content-type spoofing.
- CLI runners confined: `claude-code` runs with `--tools ""` (all tools disabled);
  `codex` runs with `--sandbox read-only`, isolated directory, no env inheritance.
- SSRF prevention: Cloudflare account IDs validated as 32-char hex strings.
- API error responses sanitized to prevent information leakage.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-04-11

### Added

- Style-aware humanization engine calibrated from academic writing statistics
  (OpenAlex, 11 domains, 2018–2025).
- Style model capturing real human writing patterns: sentence length distribution
  (mean 20.5, median 20, stddev 9.4), burstiness (0.426), vocabulary diversity
  (69.4%), passive voice ratio (18.1%), transition word frequencies, and sentence
  starter distributions.
- Style-aware prompt builder that injects corpus-calibrated statistical targets
  directly into LLM rewrite prompts.
- Corpus-calibrated detection thresholds — dynamic baselines derived from real
  academic writing rather than hardcoded values.
- Corpus-aware post-processing engine for output refinement.
- Expanded collocation database with 50+ new AI phrase replacements (150+ total).
- Bulk paper download and ingestion pipeline (`scripts/papers/`).

### Changed

- Style model (`public/corpus-style-model.json`) now loads via `fetch()` for
  client-side compatibility (no `node:fs` in browser bundle).
- AI detector uses dynamic corpus-calibrated thresholds instead of static
  heuristics.

### Fixed

- LinkedIn URL corrected in `Footer.tsx`.
- CI/CD workflow branch triggers updated from `main` to `master`.
- Client bundle crash resolved by isolating `node:fs` usage from browser-targeted
  `style-model.ts`.
- Markdown lint configuration fixed for Quality workflow.
